### Hi, I'm Aslan ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a design technologist. I work at the intersection of code and design. 

-  Iâ€™m currently working at Pluribus Digital doing design systems work for civic tech.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning design system operations and deepening my javascript skills. 
-  I also have an interest in [neural networks as an art form and medium](https://artplusmarketing.com/how-artists-can-use-neural-networks-to-make-art-714cdab53953). [Come collaborate with me](https://github.com/jcklpe/neural-network-art)
-  I have an interest in producing replicable, agile, open source cloud infrastructure for activist/civic organizations.
